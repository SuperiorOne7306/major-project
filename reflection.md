# Relfection

## Problems:
- First comes the issue of sprites having turns and attacking even after they are defeated.

- Secondly, there seems to be an error where after and enemies turn, the next allies move buttons are missing words.

- I ran into many problems while coding that I did eventually fix like buttons crashing the program when clicked or variables ending up empty.

- I did miss some elements I wanted to add like SFX and levels, but those never happened due to time constraints

## "Most Proud Of" and "Most Difficult"
- I am most proud of how easily I was able to code sprites and buttons as classes, as well as setting up the battle(spawning sprites, displaying them, random number of enemies)

- The most difficult part was definitely the moves. Having to set up a targeting system and keep track of turns was a long process that I didn't expect.
